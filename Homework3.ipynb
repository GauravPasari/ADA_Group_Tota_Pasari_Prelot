    "In this homework you will be dealing with two different datasets from the statistics offices of the European commission (eurostat) and the Swiss Confederation (amstat). They provide a variety of datasets with plenty of information on many different statistics and demographics at their respective scales. Unfortunately, as is often the case is data analysis, these websites are not always straightforward to navigate. They may include a lot of obscure categories, not always be translated into your native language, have strange link structures, … Navigating this complexity is part of a data scientists' job : you will have to use a few tricks to get the right data for this homework.\n",
