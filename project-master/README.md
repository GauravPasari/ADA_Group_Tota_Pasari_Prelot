# Title
Prediction in an Era of Unpredictability 

# Abstract
Recent geopolitical events such as the election of Trump and Brexit have, to say the least, shocked the popular opinion around the globe. Media outlets, political experts, advisors, and data scientists have all failed to come close to predicting the outcome of such events. In hindsight, however, the pieces are obvious to connect. Our goal is to analyze these major past events on the basis of common ideas and popular opinion and see how the former squashed the latter. Using these learnings, we want to try and improve our chances of predicting future events such as the current state of Catalonia. We also want to study the variables which are similar and different in each geopolitical landscape - standard of living, level of education, social media presence, type of government. Are there specific factors which largely shape such seemingly sudden political ‘bursts’ and their outcomes or is it solely the product of erratic human behavior? In this project, we will focus on the Catalan independence movement while analyzing and learning from Brexit and the election of Trump.

# Research questions
To better dissect the data and extract insights, we explore the following questions:
* Which socio-economic factors have the biggest impact, if any, in building or altering popular opinion?
* Standard and Quality of Education (Wikidata, Educational databases)
* Income and Inequality Levels (Wikidata)
* How does media through newspapers and social networks influence these events through information or misinformation? ()
	* Newspaper (Corpus Data)
	* Social Media (Twitter)
* What is the influence of the political system in place? (Wikidata) 
	* Rate of Abstention (Wikidata)
	* Demonstrations covered in media (Corpus Data)
* How far in time could we have traced the roots of such events? (Wikidata, Newspapers)
