# Title
Prediction in an era of unpredictability 

# Abstract
Recent geopolitical events such as the election of Trump and Brexit have shocked the popular opinion around the globe, to say the least. Media outlets, political experts, advisors, and data scientists have all failed to come close to predicting the outcome of such events. In hindsight, however, the pieces are obvious to connect. Our goal is to analyze these major past events on the basis of common ideas and popular opinion and see how the former squashed the latter. Using these learnings, we want to try and improve our chances of predicting future events such as the current state of Catalonia. We also want to study the variables which are similar and different in each geopolitical landscape - standard of living, level of education, social media presence, type of government - and whether or not they affect these outcomes. In this project we will focus on the case of catalan independence, brexit and recent trump election. 

# Research questions
To better understand how do such sudden political 'bursts' each questions that we will adress are the following. 
- Does the level of education change how these decisions are made? (wikidata, edication data bases) 
- Which socio - economic factor have the biggest impact? (Income level and inequality levels Wikidata) 
- What is the influnce of the political system in place? (Wikidata) 
- How far in time could be trace the germs of such event? (Wikidata, newspapers) 
- Is there a form of social media which played an integral role in one event but not the other? (
- How does the level of poplitical engagement in the population vary between the different case studies? (Rate of abstension, wikidata, demonstrations covered in newspapers)
